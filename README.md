- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nolanurban

I started out as a computer science major in 2000 at the University of Nebraska.  After 9/11 happened, I enlisted in the Marines.  I subsequently fought in Afghanistan and Iraq.

I would later leave the US Marine Corps and pursue a career in education.  I worked as an educator in Nebraska, Colorado, and Iowa.  I spent much of my time focused on STEM activities to generate curiousity and intellectual drive in the students.  When the pandemic hit, I was charged with turning the entirety of what we did in the classroom into a virtual classroom in 14 days.

We were successful!

After that experience, I decided a remote career based on problem solving was for me so, two years post pandemic -- here we aer.

Please feel to peruse my work completed during my intesive Java Full stack bootcamp course with Skill Distillery.  Additionally, the content here is hosted on AWS so feel free to create an account on those projects and play with them.

Feel free to reach out to me if you feel you've got a "right fit" opportunity for a life long learner.

Thanks,

Nolan
